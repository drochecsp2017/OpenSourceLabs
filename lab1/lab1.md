That's a horror story. I may or may not have been an RPI student in '05, all of us may or may not have been aware of this story.

Students may or may not have continued place music files in their shared folders (at least for short periods to until transfers could be completed). 

All software issues aside, it is very unfortunate that our legal system vastly favors those who can afford to litigate. What Jesse experienced was a terrible injustice. The publicity of such cases may have had a very mild affect at the time. We see an example in RPI, paying for music services so students wouldn't get sued (and whos to stop them from suing RPI or Microsoft for that matter... other than that they can afford to litigate).

This is an example of software disrupting an industry (which has since shifted and learned to cope). It also reminds me of the dangers of software patents for open source.
